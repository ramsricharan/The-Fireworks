# The-Fireworks
**My First trail with the p5.js framework. Created a fireworks effect using p5 2D shapes and p5.Sound library .**


## Project Setup
```
 Category: Personal Project
 Programming Language: Javascript (p5.js)
 IDE: p5.js Web Editor
 Platform: Web
 ```
 
 ## About
 - Built a simple physics engine which is responsible to take care of the velocity and acceleration of each particle under the gravity.
 - All the particles are created at a random point under the horizon with random velocity and direction. Once they get launched, gravity alters their flight.
 - On reaching the max height, the firework explodes creating 100 particles that shoot in random directions.
 - Used p5.Sound library to play the cracking sound during the firework explosion.
